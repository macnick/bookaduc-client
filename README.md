# BookADuc App

This is the final Microverse's capstone project. The purpose of the project is to create a Full-Stack app that works with a back-end written in Rails and a front-end in React. This repo contains the front-end part of the project. It's a React app that works as an interface to handle connections to the backend API. This is the link to the backend [bookaduc-api](https://github.com/macnick/bookaduc-api/tree/authentication).

The App can

1. Create and authenticate users
2. Get a list of available bikes to ride
3. Book an appointment for a ride
4. See the list of the user's appointments
5. Navigate using the sidebar
6. It is optimized for tablets but it is responsive and looks nice everywhere
